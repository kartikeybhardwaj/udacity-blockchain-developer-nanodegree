# Project #4. Private Blockchain Notary Service

This project is a Star Registry Service that allows users to claim ownership of their favorite star in the night sky.
This project has RESTful APIs built using Express Node.js framework that interfaces with the private blockchain built in [Project 2](https://github.com/kartikeybhardwaj/udacity-blockchain-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Blockchain%20Data) and is built upon structure of [Project 3](https://github.com/kartikeybhardwaj/udacity-blockchain-developer-nanodegree/tree/master/Project%203%20-%20Blockchain%20Web%20Services).
This project has two endpoints:
* GET block
* POST block

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Node.js runtime environment is required.

### Installing

Install all required dependencies

```
$ npm install
```

Run server

```
$ node server.js
```

## POST Block Endpoints

### #01. Validate request

This endpoint posts an address. The response in JSON format for the endpoint provides message which user has to sign in given validation window. To sign message user can use Electrum. If user requests again using same address, validation window reduces until it expires.

REQUEST:

```
TYPE: POST
URL: http://localhost:8000/requestValidation
HEADER: { Content-Type: application/json }
Example BODY:
{
    "address": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j"
}
```

RESPONSE:

```
{
    "walletAddress": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j",
    "requestTimeStamp": "1557596493",
    "message": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j:1557596493:starRegistry",
    "validationWindow": 300
}
```

### #02. Validate message signature

This endpoint posts an address with signature of message generated from previous request. If signature is valid, transaction moves to validated transaction mempool. The response in JSON format for the endpoint tells whether upon validation, the user is granted access to register a single star or not.

REQUEST:

```
TYPE: POST
URL: http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate
HEADER: { Content-Type: application/json }
Example BODY:
{
	"address": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j",
	"signature": "H7ZrgSjNuSvK7yG2Mz2hTg4TSjpToFk9aF7uDdkj9WVkRX2oPPvruweOgIE8sd9ZUM1F98Kf3l9ajOMi5+hsGAE="
}
```

RESPONSE:

```
{
    "registerStar": true,
    "status": {
        "address": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j",
        "requestTimeStamp": "1557596493",
        "message": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j:1557596493:starRegistry",
        "validationWindow": 268,
        "messageSignature": true
    }
}
```

### #03. Submit the Star information

This endpoint posts star information if transaction is in validated transaction mempool. It converts star story to hex string and adds transaction as block in blockchain removing validated transaction from mempool. The response in JSON format for the endpoint provides block data in blockchain.

REQUEST:

```
TYPE: POST
URL: http://localhost:8000/message-signature/validate
HEADER: { Content-Type: application/json }
Example BODY:
{
    "address": "1MPUSndUm6NGZqv3yekP5JrLUkY8pthm6j",
    "star": {
        "dec": "68° 52' 56.9",
        "ra": "16h 29m 1.0s",
        "story": "Found star using https://www.google.com/sky/"
    }
}
```

RESPONSE:

```

    "hash": "e5fe47ba3f0e5ff960a8d3ffe4ffe6b1c3edab27f8c3944dd895fdf50a276c3c",
